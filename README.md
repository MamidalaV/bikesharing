# Bike-Sharing

## This project is to analyse 'Citi bike sharing' data and understand if the same bike sharing business can be started in Des-Moines. 

### Using Tableau multiple visualization charts have been generated that help understand if investing in a business like this would be beneficial.

### Results:

#### While the bike sharing business have been pretty stable over past few decades, usage has seen a sharp increase over the past few years. 

#### From the below viz, we can see that between 1990 and 200 the usage is high and there are multiple reasons for this. Where one big influencer could be the autombile traffic.
